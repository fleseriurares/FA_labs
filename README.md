# Fundamental Algorithms LabðŸš€ðŸ“š

This repository contains the implementation of various fundamental algorithms and data structures covered in the algorithms lab. The following algorithms and concepts have been implemented:

## 1. Direct Sorting Methods
Implementation and performance analysis of classic sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## 2. Heap Construction and Heapsort
Efficient heap building and sorting with the Heapsort algorithm.

## 3. Heapsort vs. Quicksort
This section compares Heapsort and Quicksort in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. 

## 4. Merging k Sorted Sequences
A specialized algorithm for efficiently merging multiple sorted sequences using a priority queue.

## 5. Multi-Way Trees
Design and analysis of multi-way trees for optimized data storage and searching operations.

## 6. Dynamic Order Statistics
Algorithms for maintaining dynamic order statistics in lists, with constant time retrieval.

## 7. Iterative vs. Recursive Binary Tree Traversal
A comparative analysis of iterative and recursive tree traversal techniques.
 
## 8. Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)
Implementation of the disjoint-set data structure with optimizations for efficiency.

## 9. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
BFS algorithm implementation with complexity analysis.

## 10. DFS (Depth-First Search)
DFS algorithm implementation with complexity analysis
